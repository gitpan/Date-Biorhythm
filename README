NAME
    Date::Biorhythm - a biorhythm calculator

SYNOPSIS
    Usage

      use Date::Biorhythm;
      my $bio = Date::Biorhythm->new({
        birthday => Date::Calc::Object->new(0, 1970, 1, 1),
        name     => 'Unix',
      });

      my $i = 0;
      my $limit = 365;
      $bio->day(Date::Calc::Object->today);
      while ($i < $limit) {
        print $bio->value('emotional'), "\n";
        $bio->next;
        $i++;
      }

DESCRIPTION
    I find biorhythms mildly amusing, but I got tired of visiting
    http://www.facade.com/biorhythm and having to deal with their web-based
    form for date entry.

    I vaguely remembered there being a Perl module for biorhythm
    calculation, but I couldn't find it on CPAN. Further investigation
    finally led me to BackPAN where I found Date::Biorhythm 1.1 written by
    Terrence Brannon (a long time ago).

    Wanting an excuse to try Moose out, I decided to make a new and
    modernized version of Date::Biorhythm, and this is the result.

BUT WTF IS A BIORHYTHM?

METHODS
  new
    The constructor. It takes on optional hashref that will accept the
    following keys: name, birthday, and day.

  name
    Get or set the name associated with this biorhythm. This will usually be
    a person's name.

  birthday
    Get or set the birthday used for this biorhythm.

  day
    Get or set the current day (which is represented by a
    Date::Calc::Object).

  next
    Go forward one day by incrementing $self->day.

  prev
    Go backward one day by decrementing $self->day.

  index
    Given a primary cycle (such as 'emotional', 'intellectual', or
    'physical'), return how many days we are into the cycle. Note that the
    first day of the cycle returns 0.

  value
    Given a primary cycle or secondary cycle, return a value between -1 and
    1 that represents the current amplitude in the cycle.
